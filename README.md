## Overview
A simple Magic: the Gathering bot, implemented to be a Beep Boop hostable, Python-based Slack bot.

## Assumptions
* You have already signed up with Beep Boop and have a local fork of this project.
* You have sufficient rights in your Slack team to configure a bot and generate/access a Slack API token.

## Usage

### Run locally
Install dependencies ([virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is recommended.)

	pip install -r requirements.txt
	export SLACK_TOKEN=<YOUR SLACK TOKEN>; python ./bot/app.py

Things are looking good if the console prints something like:

	Connected <your bot name> to <your slack team> team at https://<your slack team>.slack.com.

If you want change the logging level, prepend `export LOG_LEVEL=<your level>; ` to the `python ./bot/app.py` command.

### Run locally in Docker
	sudo docker build -t tradingpost-beepboop .
	sudo docker run -d --restart=on-failure:10 -e "SLACK_TOKEN=<YOUR SLACK API TOKEN>" tradingpost-beepboop

Make sure all files are owned by root. For other restart policies, see [Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#restart-policies-restart).

### Run in BeepBoop
If you have linked your local repo with the Beep Boop service (check [here](https://beepboophq.com/0_o/my-projects)), changes pushed to the remote master branch will automatically deploy.

## Credits
I got the inspiration to make Tradingpost after seeing Filip SÃ¶derholm's [cardfetcher bot](https://github.com/fiso/cardfetcher) in action, and I have re-used part of his code while making Tradingpost.

The [BeepBoop](https://beepboophq.com/docs/article/overview) bot design of this project is heavily inspired by [BeepBoopHQ's Starter Python bot](https://github.com/BeepBoopHQ/starter-python-bot/) (MIT license).
